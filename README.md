VDR Movie and TV Shows scanner for Plex
----------------------------------------

Based on the original work by Friedhelm Buescher.
This version by Teemu Suikki.

These scanners are mostly useful for Canal Digital (Telenor) S1.0W recordings. 
Canal Digital has clear episode and season numbering, which can be parsed and
then Plex can easily find correct metadata.

There are separate scanners for Movies and TV Shows. TV Show scanner only
matches recordings which have episode number available, and Movie scanner
matches the rest.

Installation:
--------------

Just clone this repository somewhere, and copy or link the Scanners directory to your
"Plex Media Server" directory.
